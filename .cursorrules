# Feature-Sliced Design (FSD) Rules
You must strictly follow FSD architecture for all code generation and refactoring.

## Layer Hierarchy
Always respect the hierarchy (top-to-bottom only):
1. App: Setup, styles, and providers.
2. Processes (Optional): Complex multi-step flows.
3. Pages: Full views composed of widgets and features.
4. Widgets: Self-contained UI blocks (e.g., Header, Sidebar).
5. Features: User-facing value (e.g., AddToCart, AuthByEmail).
6. Entities: Business logic (e.g., User, Product, Order).
7. Shared: Reusable UI, API clients, and utils.

## Strict Restrictions
- NEVER allow cross-imports within the same layer (e.g., Feature A cannot import Feature B).
- ONLY use Public APIs (`index.ts`) to export from a slice. Deep imports are forbidden.
- Components in 'Shared' must be logic-agnostic.
- Business logic should stay in 'Entities' or 'Features'.

## File Structure
Each slice folder should contain:
- `ui/`: Components.
- `model/`: State, types, and logic.
- `lib/`: Internal utils.
- `api/`: Requests (if applicable).
- `index.ts`: The public API.
